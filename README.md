# Snowflake Demo Project

## Overview  
This project is a hands‑on introduction to Snowflake. We are learning how to set up databases and schemas, create tables, run queries, and explore more advanced concepts like staging, bulk loading, and pivoting data. 

## What We’ve Done So Far  
- Created a demo database and schema (`demo_db`, `demo_sc`)  
- Built a sample table `emp` with basic columns  
- Inserted and queried data using `SELECT` statements  
- Learned about **stages** (internal vs external) and how they act as parking lots for files before loading into tables  
- Practiced **loading CSV files** into Snowflake using the Web UI and stages  
- Explored **bulk staging and loading** with multiple files  
- Understood **pivoting in SQL** to transform rows into columns  
- Used `EXPLAIN` to see how queries are executed and to think about performance  
- Discussed how to save SQL scripts and push them into GitHub for version control
